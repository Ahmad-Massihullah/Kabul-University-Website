			<h3>About KU</h3><br><br>
		
			<p>Kabul University is proud to have played a significant role, and have had positive effect, in the service, development, leadership and progress of the Afghan society from day one of its inception till now. 

It is natural that the misfortunes of the last four decades would have damaged the Kabul University as well as would have disrupted its capacity development to some extent, yet, with the help of Allah Almighty and then with the best of our ability, we are committed to reviving the affected aspects of this national academic site as soon as possible. 

Since the countryâ€™s independence from the 20-year occupation, now there is more opportunity than ever for providing such an academic environment in this academic institution that is concomitant with the spirit of religion and national values. This is one of our priorities, and we consider our duty to train such leaders for the future of Afghanistan who, along with professional knowledge, have a sense of pride in their Afghan identity and culture also. I believe that the academic staff of Kabul University is committed to this goal. 

Over the course of its 90-year history, besides the Afghan students, it has provided significant opportunities for many foreign students also to study in various fields, and still welcomes more.

I am pleased to invite you on behalf of the Kabul University to choose one of the 22 faculties and over 100 departments of this academic foundation for your higher education and thus be able to truly serve your nation. 

I wish you all the success.<br>

Dr. Ahmad Massihullah Mohmand  <br>

Chancellor of Kabul University.</p>
